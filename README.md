# Calculator
FPGA project

Components:
• Adder
• Register
• State machine
• Port mapping
• FPGA max 10
• 7 segment
• Clk division
• 4 to 1 mux

One of the important requirements in using FPGA is a calculator, and we can
perform calculations with high accuracy. In this project we will learn how to
design a calculator using the VHDL language. It contains operations
(subtraction, division, addition, and multiplication) through Design and
implementation of arithmetic units, control units, user interfaces, and display
units, all of which are necessary to implement the functions of the calculator.
